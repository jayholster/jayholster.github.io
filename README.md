# Dynamic Topic Modeling: Leonard Bernstein's Young People's Concerts

I'm attached to the idea that artificial intelligence will become a core component to social science research in the coming years. In my own work, I use natural language processing tools in order to make meaning out of huge datasets. The tools we use to understand the world are already more powerful and more accessible than ever. Researchers, teachers, and the like should feel empowered to identify and use statistical thinking alongside contemporary tools of analysis in the pursuit of some objective truth. 

What follows is an attempt to engage in historical research with dyanmic topic modeling, which can be used to analyze change in unobserved topics over time within a set of documents (Blei & Lafferty, 2006).

## Building the Primary Source Dataset
### Part 1: Mining HTML data

36 out of 53 transcripts for the Young People's Concerts (YPCs) were available on the Leonard Bernstein Office's online archives. I used the beautiful soup and requests python libraries in order to read in all of the html at each respective url. Once each website is read into python, each transcript was appended to the list 'alltranscripts' for futher processing. 

```python
import requests 
from urllib import request, response, error, parse
from urllib.request import urlopen
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
import re

urls = ["https://leonardbernstein.com/lectures/television-scripts/young-peoples-concerts/what-does-music-mean",
        "https://leonardbernstein.com/lectures/television-scripts/young-peoples-concerts/what-is-american-music"]
#You can list as many urls here as you like. 

alltranscripts = [] #serves as a placeholder for processed data

# This function calls each url in the list of urls, reads the html data using requests and the parser 'lxml'. 
for url in urls: 
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "lxml")
    transcripts = soup.find_all(class_='col3') 
    #class = 'col3' refers to the common HTML containers which held all transcript data.  
    for item in transcripts:
        alltranscripts.append(item.text)

```

### Part 2: Finding missing data

I contacted the archivist at the Leonard Bernstein Office to inquire about the missing transcripts. They responded quickly, attaching pdfs of typewritten transcripts. I was able to locate all but three transcripts, which the archivist indicated were not going to be developed into transcripts. 

I converted pdfs to txt files using the script below. While there are pdf parsers available for python, I found the most success using the pdftools library in R.

```R
files <- list.files(pattern = 'pdf$')
files
library(pdftools)
transcripts1 <- lapply(files, pdf_text)
transcripts1
```

Additionally, I discovered that Jamie Bernstein, daughter of Leonard Bernstein, hosted a Young People's Concert as part of the Bernstein at 100 festival which took place at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2018. After contacting represetentatives of the College of Music, I was able to procure a transcript of this event and add it to my list.
