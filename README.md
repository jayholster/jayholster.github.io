## Qualitative Statistical Thinking

Lorem Ipsum.

```python
df = pd.concat(dfs, join = 'outer', ignore_index=False, sort = True)
df = df.drop_duplicates()
df = df.dropna(how = 'all')
df.to_csv('test1.csv')
```

### Purpose Statement

I'm attached to the idea that artificial intelligence will become a core component to social science research in the coming years. In my own work, I use natural language processing tools in order to make meaning out of huge datasets. The tools we use to understand the world are already more powerful and more accessible than ever. Researchers, teachers, and the like should feel empowered to identify and use statistical thinking in the pursuit of some objective truth.
